"What R package can be used to calculate ATR?","The R package that can be used to calculate the Average True Range (ATR) is the `TTR` package.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Where would I use the lapply() function?","The `lapply()` function in R is commonly used for applying a function over a list or vector and returning a list of the same length. It is particularly useful when you want to perform operations on each element of a list without using explicit loops.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"How to make R print the line number where an error occurred?","To make R print the line number where an error occurred, you can use the option `options(show.error.locations = TRUE)`. This setting allows R to display the location of errors in the output, which can help in debugging your code. Additionally, using debugging tools like `traceback()` can provide insights into the sequence of function calls leading to the error, although it may not always capture the exact line number if the context is not set up correctly.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17

"What causes the 'no visible binding for global variable' error?","The 'no visible binding for global variable' error typically occurs when using non-standard evaluation in R, particularly in package development. This happens when a variable is referenced in a function but is not explicitly defined in the global environment or within the function's scope. For instance, if a function returns a data frame from an SQL query and uses column names that are not defined as variables, R CMD check will flag these as potential issues. The error indicates that R cannot find a binding for these variables, which may lead to confusion about their existence during checks.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Are there any problems with the lm function?","There are some noted issues with the lm function, particularly regarding the differences in residuals when compared to the lm.fit function. Yuan Chun Ding mentioned that while using lm.fit with a matrix format is faster, the residual values for certain variables were different between the two functions, with Pearson correlations of 0.55, 0.89, and 0.99. This discrepancy raised questions about whether an intercept is required in the design matrix, indicating potential confusion or issues in model specification (Yuan Chun Ding, 2024-08-10). Additionally, John Sorkin expressed a desire for better documentation and best practices for writing system functions like lm, suggesting that understanding its internal workings can be complex and not efficiently documented (John Sorkin, 2025-01-07).","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17

"Please tell me how to plot minor tick marks.","To plot minor tick marks on a log scale using ggplot2, you can use the guide_axis(minor.ticks = TRUE) function. Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement this: guides(y = guide_axis(minor.ticks = TRUE)). Alternatively, you can define a custom function for minor breaks, as shown in the following example: minor_breaks = rep(log10(seq(1, 9, by=1)), times = n_major) + rep(major_breaks, each = 9)","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Please tell me how to plot tick marks not using ggplot.","The retrieved emails do not provide information on how to plot tick marks without using ggplot. They focus specifically on adding major and minor tick marks in ggplot, particularly on log scales. Therefore, I cannot provide guidance on plotting tick marks outside of ggplot based on the available information.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17

"How to search R-help mailing list with keywords?","You can search the R-help mailing list using a search engine by adding `site:stat.ethz.ch` to your search query. For example, you can use a search engine like DuckDuckGo and format your query as follows: `keywords site:stat.ethz.ch`. This will help you find posts related to your keywords within the mailing list archives.","""Jan 2025""",hybrid,chain,cloud,2025-07-10
"What is the code for printing the line number that caused an error message?","The code for printing the line number that caused an error message is:\n\n```R\noptions(error = showKnownLocations)\n```\n\nYou can also use the following function to show the known locations in the call stack:\n\n```R\nshowKnownLocations <- function() {\n   calls <- sys.calls()\n   srcrefs <- sapply(calls, function(v) if (!is.null(srcref <- attr(v, ""srcref""))) {\n     srcfile <- attr(srcref, ""srcfile"")\n     paste0(basename(srcfile$filename), ""#"", srcref[1L])\n   } else ""."")\n   cat(""Current call stack locations:\\n"")\n   cat(srcrefs, sep = "" "")\n   cat(""\\n"")\n}\n```. To print the line number that caused an error message in R, you can also use the traceback() function after an error occurs. Ensure that you run your script with the source() function using the parameter keep.source = TRUE.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Are there macros?","Your question about ""macros"" is quite broad. To provide a more helpful response, it would be beneficial to specify what type of macros you are referring to in R. For example, are you asking about: - Macros in the context of R programming (like functions or code snippets)? - Macros related to specific packages or libraries in R? - A comparison between R macros and macros in other programming languages? If you can clarify your question, I can assist you better or suggest how to phrase it for the R-help mailing list.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Are there macros in R? Search the list archives.","R does not have a built-in macro facility. The discussions in the R-help mailing list indicate that R was designed as a function-based language, and while some users have suggested that a macro language could aid in code development, it has not been implemented. Richard O'Keefe mentioned that R is closely modeled on S, which was designed to work well with UNIX tools that have their own macro processors, like cpp and m4. He also pointed out that R's features allow for 'computing on the language', which could serve similar purposes to macros, but does not constitute a macro system itself (Richard O'Keefe, 2025-05-23). Bert Gunter noted that there may have been discussions about a macro facility in the past, but he could not recall specific implementations (Bert Gunter, 2025-05-23). Therefore, while the concept of macros has been discussed, R does not currently support them as a formal feature.","January 2024 - June 2025",hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17

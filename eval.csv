"What R package can be used to calculate ATR?","To calculate the Average True Range (ATR) in R, you can use the `TTR` package. The `ATR` function from this package allows you to compute the ATR based on high, low, and close prices. If you have multiple stocks in one dataset, you can create a custom function to calculate the ATR for each stock symbol separately. Here’s an example of how to do this:",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"Where would I use the lapply() function?","The `lapply()` function in R is commonly used to replace for loops, especially when you want to apply a function to each element of a list or vector. For instance, Akshay Kulkarni mentioned using `lapply()` to replace a large for loop while also reporting progress. He provided an example where `lapply()` is used to print the current iteration variable and perform computations:",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"How to make R print the line number where an error occurred?","To make R print the line number where an error occurred, you can use the option `options(show.error.locations = TRUE)`. This setting allows R to display the line number in the error message, which can be very helpful for debugging. Additionally, using debugging tools like `traceback()` can provide more context about the error, although it may not always capture the line number if the error occurs in a context that doesn't set it up properly.",2024-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"Was Python mentioned in January 2025?","Yes, Python was mentioned in January 2025. In a discussion about programming languages, it was noted that R, like Python, was not designed for novice users and has evolved to become less user-friendly over time. The conversation highlighted that as programming languages become more powerful, they often become more complex and less accessible to beginners. This was part of a broader discussion on debugging tools and user experience in programming languages, including R and Python.",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"Was Julia (the programming language) mentioned in January 2025?","There were no mentions of the Julia programming language in the R-help mailing list during January 2025. The retrieved emails from that month did not include any discussions or references to Julia.",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"What causes the 'no visible binding for global variable' error?","The 'no visible binding for global variable' error typically occurs when using non-standard evaluation in R, particularly in package development. This happens when a variable is referenced in a function but is not explicitly defined in the global environment or within the function's scope. For instance, if a function returns a data frame from an SQL query and uses column names that are not defined as variables, R CMD check will flag these as potential issues. The error indicates that R cannot find a binding for these variables, which may lead to confusion about their existence during checks.",2024-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Are there any problems with the lm function?","There are some discussions regarding potential issues with the `lm` function in R. One notable point raised by Yuan Chun Ding on August 10, 2024, is the difference in residuals obtained from the `lm` function compared to `lm.fit`. Ding observed that the residual values for three tested variables were different, with Pearson correlations of 0.55, 0.89, and 0.99, and he was uncertain about the reasons for this discrepancy. He suggested that adding an intercept to the design matrix might be necessary to align the results from both functions (Yuan Chun Ding, 2024-08-10). Additionally, John Sorkin discussed the complexity of the `lm` function's argument processing, noting that much of the initial processing is not directly related to running a regression but is essential for determining user intentions. He expressed a desire for documentation on best practices for writing such system functions (John Sorkin, 2025-01-07).",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"Please tell me how to plot the R logo.","Ranjan Maitra inquired about code for drawing the R logo, and while no specific code was provided, the logo is available in SVG and PNG formats at the official R project website. For ASCII art representation, J C Nash mentioned a link to an ASCII art version of the R logo, which can be found at https://dahtah.github.io/imager/ascii_art.html. However, this is not a plot but rather a text representation of the logo.",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
"Please tell me how to plot minor tick marks.","To plot minor tick marks on a log scale using ggplot2, you can use the guide_axis(minor.ticks = TRUE) function. Here’s an example of how to implement this: guides(y = guide_axis(minor.ticks = TRUE)). Alternatively, you can define a custom function for minor breaks, as shown in the following example: minor_breaks = rep(log10(seq(1, 9, by=1)), times = n_major) + rep(major_breaks, each = 9)",2024-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Please tell me how to plot tick marks not using ggplot.","To plot tick marks in R without using ggplot, you can utilize the base R plotting functions. Here’s a simple approach to create a plot with custom tick marks:\n\n1. Use the `plot()` function to create your initial plot.\n2. Suppress the default axes using `axes=FALSE`.\n3. Add your own axes using the `axis()` function.",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,chain,cloud,2025-07-19
"On what date was has.HLC mentioned in a message?","The function has.HLC was mentioned in a message by Joshua Ulrich on January 5, 2025. In the context of the email, it was used to identify columns in a data frame that contain high, low, and close prices for stock data when calculating the Average True Range (ATR) for multiple symbols. The relevant code snippet included the use of has.HLC to extract the necessary columns from the input data frame.",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,chain,cloud,2025-07-19
"When was has.HLC mentioned in 2024?","There is no mention of `has.HLC` in the retrieved emails from 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide any information regarding its mention or context.",2024-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-18
"How to search the R-help mailing list with a search engine?","To search the R-help mailing list using a search engine, you can utilize the `site:` operator to limit your search to the specific domain where the mailing list archives are hosted. For example, you can use a search engine like DuckDuckGo or Google and include the following format in your query:\n\n```\n<your search term> site:stat.ethz.ch\n```\n\nThis will restrict the search results to pages from the R-help mailing list archives hosted at the ETH Zurich website",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,chain,cloud,2025-07-19
"What is the code for printing the line number that caused an error message?","The code for printing the line number that caused an error message is:\n\n```R\noptions(error = showKnownLocations)\n```\n\nYou can also use the following function to show the known locations in the call stack:\n\n```R\nshowKnownLocations <- function() {\n   calls <- sys.calls()\n   srcrefs <- sapply(calls, function(v) if (!is.null(srcref <- attr(v, ""srcref""))) {\n     srcfile <- attr(srcref, ""srcfile"")\n     paste0(basename(srcfile$filename), ""#"", srcref[1L])\n   } else ""."")\n   cat(""Current call stack locations:\\n"")\n   cat(srcrefs, sep = "" "")\n   cat(""\\n"")\n}\n```. To print the line number that caused an error message in R, you can also use the traceback() function after an error occurs. Ensure that you run your script with the source() function using the parameter keep.source = TRUE.",2024-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-17
"Are there macros?","In the R-help mailing list, there was a discussion regarding the absence of a macro facility in R. John Sorkin raised a question about why the R core team did not develop a macro language for R, acknowledging that R is designed as a function-based language but suggesting that macros could aid in code development (John Sorkin, 2025-05-23). Richard O'Keefe responded by noting that R's design and approach to optional and keyword arguments make it fundamentally different from languages that support macros, implying that the integration of macros would not align well with R's existing structure (Richard O'Keefe, 2025-06-16). This indicates a consensus that while macros could be beneficial, they may not fit well within R's functional programming paradigm.",2022-January,2025-June,hybrid,graph,cloud,2025-07-19
